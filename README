Introduction
============

This is a KDE control center module to configure and control the Uncomplicated
Firewall, as shipped with Kubuntu 11.04. The following features are supported:

1. Enable/disable firewall
2. Configure firewall default settings
3. Add, edit, and remove rules
4. Re-order rules via drag'n'drop
5. Creation, and basic manipulation, of firewall profiles
6. Import/export of firewall profiles
7. Setting of some IP tables modules

Components
==========

The code is split into 3 main parts:

1. GUI - this is the main control module
2. KAuth helper - kcm_ufw_helper. This a simpe C++ application that receives
   instructions (via KAuth) from the control module - it then invokes the
   appropriate commands on the python helper.
3. UFW interface - kcm_ufw_helper.py. This performs all the actions upon UFW.
   Its written in Python to take advantage of UFW's python API.

It should be possible to merge both helpers into a single KDE4 based python
helper.
