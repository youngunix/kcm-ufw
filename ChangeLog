0.4.0
-----
 1. Add a simple log file viewer.
 2. Save profiles into /etc/kcm_ufw - this way they are system-wide.

    kcm, not ufw itself.
 4. Block further actions, until current one is complete.
 5. Set size of policy combos in simple and advanced pages to the
    same size - to mimimize flicker. (Not sure why they have
    different sizes.)
 6. Make text field of simple port the same size as the combo.
 7. Change column order of rules list to "Action, From, To, ..."
 8. Make 'Add Rule' dialog non-modal, so that 'Log Viewer' and

    and destination.

    firewall status), and as a background pixmap in add/edit dialog.
11. Only set rules list column sizes after first non-empty list.
